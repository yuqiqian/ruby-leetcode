This is the first big web app I built with Ruby and Rails. 

This web app allow visitors to sign up, log in, write and publish a post or comment, private or public, and visit other public post. Uses of Bloccit also has role such as admin, moderator, and standard, so that the site owner can manage post and comment more easily.
